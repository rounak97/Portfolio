### Experience Detroit Engineered Products

Associate Project Engineer | August 2022 - Present | Chennai

• Conducted various FEA simulations, including torque, ripples, force generation, and
sensitivity analysis of PMS motors using Ansys Maxwell, achieving a 15% increase in
simulation accuracy.

• Identified 10+ key performance indicators (KPIs) for client Stellantis and developed
data dashboards, improving decision-making efficiency by 20%.

• Created presentations and visualizations of data using Excel and Pandas, summarizing
key insights that led to a 25% increase in sales team's performance.

### Projects 

### Credit Risk Modelling

• Developed models to predict loan approval based on customer financial data to
minimize non-performing assets, achieving an accuracy of 78%.

• Employed hyperparameter tuning techniques such as GridSearchCV and
RandomSearchCV, improving model performance by 5%.

### Customer Churn Prediction

• Analyzed Telco Customer Churn dataset using exploratory data analysis (EDA),
identifying key churn factors.

• Applied various classifiers including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier,
Decision Tree Classifier, and KNN Classifier, achieving a maximum AUC score of 0.713.

• Evaluated performance using various metrics like ROC, AUC, Precision and Recall, with
a Precision of 0.84 and a Recall of 0.92.

### BigMart Sales Prediction

• Utilized data cleaning and imputation techniques with libraries such as Pandas,
Numpy and Klib to handle missing values and standardize data, followed by detailed
EDA using Seaborn, Dtale and Pandas Profiling.

• Implemented Random Forest and XGBoost Regressor models, achieving an R2 of 0.65
and 0.75 respectively and optimized the models using GridSearchCV, leading to
improved prediction accuracy.

• Conducted label encoding and feature scaling to prepare the data and saved the final
models with Joblib library for future use.

### Zomato Sales Analysis

• This project utilized a sample dataset from Zomato, a popular restaurant discovery
and food delivery platform. Used various SQL concepts like joins and window functions
to gain insights into the data.

• Each customer's total expenditure on Zomato was calculated, with significant
spending patterns and behaviors observed.
